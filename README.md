# Terminal AI

Description: My attempts/research into the terminal challenge and apply different machine learning techniques to maximize my score.


### Notes:

 - This game does support a local "offline" mode (see the README.md in the Starter Algorithm repo). The only caveat is that it requires Java (JDK v10+ according to the README.md).
